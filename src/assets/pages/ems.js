			    BERT O' CLOCK
		    </a>
	    </h2>
	    <p><b>Technologies:</b> p5.js</p><br/>
	    <p>Ask Bert for the time and depending on the time of day, he may or may not give you what you want. From 12:00 pm to 11:59 pm, poke him and he'll give you the time in binary on his fingers. Otherwise, tough luck.</p>

	    <ProjectModalImage size="small" imgPath="./ems/bert2.gif"/>
	    <p style={{textAlign:"center", paddingTop:"0px"}}>Who knows...</p>
	    <p>I was interested in something with keeping time with your hands and I noticed our four fingers looked like the four digits of a byte in binary code. I wanted a playful interaction to remind us to not take time to seriously.</p>

			    Cloud Simulator: Face Motion Capture
		    </a>
		</h2>
	    <p><b>Technologies:</b> p5.js, <a href="https://glitch.com/~cmuems-clm-networked-face" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">template with clmTracker</a>, <a href="https://brm.io/matter-js/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matter.js</a> for the physics</p><br/>
	    <p>Why go outside when you can vicariously experience the great outdoors as a cloud? Turn your head and blow yourself back and forth.</p>
	    <ProjectModalImage size="med" imgPath="./ems/cloudy.gif"/>
	    <p>I really like clouds. One of the commonalities among some examples of face tracking I've seen is giving non-human objects human qualities, so I thought I'd try it with clouds.</p>

	    <h2 style={{fontWeight:"normal"}}>Karen: Arduino Automaton</h2>
	    <p><b>Materials:</b> cardboard, miscellaneous items from the Pittsburgh Center for Creative Reuse, laser-cut acrylis. The arm mechanism is based on a blueprint generated by Linkage.</p><br/>
	    <p>This is "Karen," your average unreasonably demanding suburban mom. Look into those soulless eyes and and just try to refuse her when she insists on having a floppy rat that you know she's going to hate.</p>
	    <ProjectModalImage size="small" imgPath="./ems/karen.gif"/>
	    <p>The assignment was to build an "automaton" with an arduino with a partner that would wake up when someone was near and perform an interaction.</p>
